TutorialText00_70 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|VEGA]\n\n![img=tutorial/iconShips.png]\n\nA turn-based strategy game for 2-6 players in a retro 80s design. Who conquers the most planets with spaceships wins the game. The players enter their moves, which the computer evaluates after each round.\n\nSince diplomatic skills are required in addition to strategic thinking and a bit of luck, VEGA is most fun in a group of at least four players. There are no computer opponents, nor are there any graphics or sound effects. As was usual in the early 80's, you don't need a mouse. All entries are made via the keyboard.\n\nIn this tutorial you are Commander ![color=3|Alice]. Conquer the universe from your planet ![color=3|LM] and assert yourself against your fellow players ![color=4|Bob] and ![color=5|Carol].

TutorialText01_71 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|The game board]\n\n![img=tutorial/board.png]\n\nThe STAR game board is a grid of square sectors named AA through RT. The sectors have an edge length of one light year (1 ly). In the center of some sectors are planets.\n\nThe planets (![color=3|LM], ![color=4|CH] and ![color=5|ND]) belong to the players (![color=3|Alice], ![color=4|Bob ] and ![color=5|Carol]). All other planets, e.g. ![color=2|JM], are neutral at the start of the game.\n\nSpaceships flying from one planet to another move in a straight line from the center of the start sector to the center of the target sector. The distance between the planets ![color=3|LM] and ![color=2|JM] is exactly 2 ly. Between ![color=3|LM] and ![color=2|LJ] it is 3 ly and between ![color=3|LM] and ![color=2|JJ] 3.606 ly.

TutorialText02_72 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|The year]\n\nVEGA is turn-based. At VEGA, a round is called a year. The game begins in year 1. Players enter their turns at the beginning of each year. The computer evaluates the moves and moves the spaceships. Then the next round of entries begins.\n\n![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Spaceships]\n\nPlayers can send different types of spaceships from planet to planet or to specific sectors. Each type of spaceship has a certain speed. The arrival time of a spaceship can be accurately predicted from the speed and distance between start and destination.\n\nMost spaceship types fly 2 light years per year. Thus they cover the distance between the planets ![color=3|LM] and ![color=2|JM] in exactly one year. For the way from ![color=3|LM] to ![color=2|LJ] you need 1.5 light years.

TutorialText03_73 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Battleships]\n\nBattleships are the most important spaceship type. Only they can conquer and defend planets. They fly 2 ly/year.\n\nYou send battleships from one planet to another in fleets of 1 to infinitely many ships. You can recognize battleship fleets on the playing field by the icon ![img=tutorial/iconFighters12x12.png]. The color of the icon identifies the player who launched the fleet.\n\nThere are battleship fleets on the planets, which you can use for attack or defense. You can see these in the list at the top right of the screen. So there are currently 6 battleships on the planet ![color=2|ED]. At the start of the game, there are 350 battleships on the players' planets.\n\nTo conquer an alien planet, send a fleet of battleships there. When attacking a planet, the attacker's individual battleships fight in turn against the individual battleships on the planet, including the defending battleships. An attacking ship has a 45% chance of surviving, a defending one 55%. The fight is decided as soon as one party has lost all battleships. If the attacker's battleships remain, the attacker takes over the planet with its remaining battleships. You should therefore only attack a planet with a clear superiority in order to have a high probability of winning the battle.\n\nSend battleship fleets to your own planets to increase their defenses.\n\nBy the way: Since there are no computer opponents, there is no danger from the neutral planets.

TutorialText04_74 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Planets]\n\nThe number of planets you own determines victory or defeat. In addition, planets form your base for the production of new spaceships.\n\nPlanets produce between $1 to $15 annually. For every $ produced, a new battleship is created. While entering your moves, you can change the default production of battleships on your planet and use the saved $ supply to buy other types of spaceships and defensive battleships. For $, you can also increase the planet's production in $4 increments up to $100/year.\n\nNow open the planet editor for your planet ![color=3|LM]. To do this, first press the ![inverse|1] key for "Alice" in the main menu to start entering your moves. In the move input menu, now select ![inverse|0] for "Planet" and then type "LM".

TutorialText05_75 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|The planet editor]\n\nYou can now see the data of your planet ![color=3|LM]. Like all of the player's planets at the beginning of the game, it has $30 supply and produces $10 per year and thus 10 new battleships per year.\n\nIn addition, all player planets have 350 defensive battleships at the start of the game, which will defend the planet in addition to the regular battleships. You can have up to 700 defensive battleships on a planet. You do not see in the planet list whether a foreign planet has defensive battleships. This will require you to send a spy to the planet, but we'll get to that later.\n\nBelow that you see a list of other spaceship types that you can buy or sell at 2/3 of the purchase price. The prices for all items change annually, but are the same on all planets in the universe.\n\nUse the up and down cursor keys to navigate to the item you want. You can use the left and right cursor keys to decrease or increase a value or the number of an item.\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Move the cursor to the line "Production of battleships/year" and decrease the value to 0 and apply the changes. Do not buy or sell any other items!]\n\nOnly when you have solved this task will the tutorial continue. If you accidentally bought or sold other items, exit the editor with the ![inverse|ESC] key and start it again for the planet ![color=3|LM].\n\nIn the planet editor, press ![inverse|ENTER] to accept the changes and complete the task.

TutorialText06_76 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Launch battleships]\n\nThe change of battleship production on planet ![color=3|LM] was successful. The move was registered and will be implemented in the evaluation of the first year.\n\nWe now want to start conquering nearby planets. In the move input menu there is the menu item ![inverse|1] "Battleships". Determine the start and destination planets of the fleet and the number of battleships.\n\nHow many battleships you have to send out depends on the number of batlleships currently on the planet and the annual batllleship production of the target planet. You won't actually see batlleship production until you have a spy on the planet. Or you can observe in the following evaluations how many battleships have landed on the planet. Also, keep in mind that there might be defensive battleships on your fellow players' planets!\n\nIn the early stages of the game, however, it is relatively easy to conquer a neutral planet. There are no defensive battleships on neutral planets, and production ranges from 1 to 15 battleships per year. So if you want to conquer planets that you can reach by next year, you're safe with 35 battleships.\n\nYou now want to conquer Planet ![color=2|JM]. There are 8 battleships. If you attack with 35 battleships, you will have a high probability of conquering the planet.\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Send 35 battleships from your planet LM to planet JM.]

TutorialText07_77 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Launch more battleships]\n\nPress the cursor button right. Where you previously saw the list of battleships on the planets, you now see the list of spaceships currently en route. You see that your 35 battleships are flying from planet ![color=3|LM] to ![color=2|JM] and will arrive at the end of year 1.\n\nKeep pressing the right cursor key to see additional information until you see the battleship list again.\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Send another 35 battleships from your planet LM to planet JJ.]

TutorialText08_78 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Buy a spy]\n\nYou have now sent two battleship fleets on the journey. If you weren't in the tutorial but in a "real" game, you should send your remaining 280 battleships from planet ![color=3|LM] to other planets. Finally, the neutral planets produce new battleships every year, making them more expensive to capture each year. And thanks to the 350 defensive battleships, your planet ![color=3|LM] is well protected against conquests in the first few years.\n\nWe are now getting to know the new spaceship type spy. Spies offer you full insight into the data of a planet until the end of the game. The spy's ship is lost when it arrives on a foreign planet. You can transfer a spy to a planet to continue using it from there. You can recognize spies by the icon ![img=tutorial/iconScout12x12.png]. Spies in "Mission" mode fly 4 ly/year and are the fastest spaceships in the VEGA universe.\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Open the planet editor of your planet LM and buy a single spy. Then exit the planet editor again with the ENTER key.]

TutorialText09_79 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Launch a spy]\n\nThe planet ![color=2|NI] that lies between you and ![color=5|Carol's] planet ![color=5|ND] could become of strategic importance. In order to know the production dates of the planet later in the game, you should send a spy there early on. To do this, select the menu item ![inverse|3] "Spy" in the move input menu.\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Send a spy in "Mission" mode from planet LM to planet NI.]

TutorialText10_7A = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|The annual evaluation]\n\nYou have now entered all your year 1 moves. Complete the move input with the ![inverse|TAB] key and confirm the prompt with ![inverse|1] "Yes". Start the evaluation with ![inverse|TAB] "Evaluation" and go through the evaluation with the keys ![inverse|TAB] or ![inverse|0].\n\nNow movement comes into play. Spaceships move from the starting planets to their destinations. You'll see a "Day x of 365" progress bar moving along as you do this. Spaceships are moved on a daily basis. An evaluation year consists of 365 days. You can see on which day a spaceship reaches its destination in the spaceship list. If two events take place on the same day, chance decides the order.\n\nOn the last day of the year, the first battleships reach the planets ![color=2|CF], ![color=2|CJ], ![color=2|LD], ![color=2|NF] and ![color =2|JM].\n\nTowards the end of the evaluation, a battleship fleet, a minelayer, and two spies are still on the move, which will reach their destinations in the years to come.\n\nAt the end of the evaluation, all planets produce $ and new battleships. Then the new year 2 begins and you are back in the main menu.

TutorialText11_7B = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|The situation in year 2]\n\nStart the move input again for your user ![color=3|Alice] and let's analyze your situation first:\n\nYou have successfully conquered the planet ![color=3|JM]. Now open the planet editor for the new planet ![color=3|JM]. The planet is very valuable with its annual production of $8. You should protect it with defensive battleships as soon as possible. But the planet currently has too little $ supply for that.\n\nYou can also see that ![color=4|Bob] has sent a spy to your new planet ![color=3|JM]. However, this only achieves its destination in the evaluation of year 3.\n\nYour battleships to planet ![color=2|JJ] will reach their destination in the next evaluation. There are now 12 battleships on the planet, but that shouldn't be a problem given the attacking 35 battleships.

TutorialText12_7C = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Buy a transporter]\n\nYou would like to have defensive battleships on your new planet ![color=3|JM] as soon as possible. You could now reduce the annual battleship production to 0, saving yourself $8 annually. On the other hand, you cannot do without the new battleships.\n\nYou also want capture the spy that ![color=4|Bob] is sending to your planet ![color=3|JM] with a patrol.\n\nTherefore use the spaceship type transporter to transport $ from the supply of the planet ![color=3|LM] to the planet ![color=3|JM].\n\nTransporters can carry $0 to $30 from planet to planet. They can be used as often as you like. When a transporter reaches an alien planet, it is lost and its cargo is transferred to the planet. Transporters fly 2 ly/year. Transporters are represented with the icon ![img=tutorial/iconTransport12x12.png].\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Open the planet editor of your planet LM and buy a single transporter. Then exit the planet editor again with the ENTER key.]

TutorialText13_7D = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Launch a transporter]\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Send a transporter with $30 cargo from planet LM to planet JM.]

TutorialText14_7E = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Evaluation of year 2]\n\nNow finish entering the moves for year 2 and start the evaluation. In the course of evaluation you will conquer planet ![color=2|JJ] and have a spy on planet ![color=2|NI]. Also, your transporter will reach planet ![color=3|JM].\n\nAfter the evaluation, start entering the moves for year 3. Since you now have a spy on planet ![color=2|NI], you can view its production data at any time with the planet editor.

TutorialText15_7F = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Buy a patrol]\n\nNow that you have enough $ on planet ![color=3|JM] to buy a patrol, let's intercept the alien spy who will reach planet ![color=3|JM] in the next evaluation.\n\nSend a patrol to a planet or any sector. Traveling at 1x the speed of light, it captures enemy spies, transports, minelayers, minesweepers, transferred patrols, and battleship fleets of five ships or fewer within a radius of 1.5 ly. Captured ships do not move any further for the rest of the evaluation. For the captured ships you have to select a new target planet in the following year.\n\nIf two opposing patrols meet in action, a fight ensues. The patrol that captures the other at a smaller angle to the direction of flight wins.\n\nWhen a patrol reaches an alien planet, it is lost. If a patrol reaches one of your planets, you can deploy it again from there.\n\nIf the patrol's destination is a sector and not a planet, the patrol turns around and flies back the path to its starting planet in the next year. It can also capture alien spaceships on the way back.\n\nYou can also transfer patrols to another planet. Transferred patrols move at twice the speed of light, but do not capture other ships.\n\nYou can recognize patrols by the icon ![img=tutorial/iconPatrol12x12.png].\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Open the planet JM editor and buy a single patrol. Then exit the planet editor again with the ENTER key.]

TutorialText16_7G = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Launch a patrol]\n\nNow send your newly acquired patrol from planet ![color=3|JM] towards the foreign spy so that the spy gets into the patrol's observation area and is captured.\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Send a patrol in "Mission" mode from planet JM to sector IL.]

TutorialText17_7H = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Evaluation of year 3]\n\nNow complete entering the moves for year 3 and start the evaluation.\n\nYou will see your patrol picking up and capturing the alien spy immediately after launch. The spy is now waiting for you to send him to another planet at the beginning of the next move input. It will fly there in "Transfer" mode, i.e. it can be re-deployed from the target planet. Your patrol flies on to sector ![color=2|IL], which it will reach in year 4. There it will turn around and fly back to planet ![color=3|JM] in the year 5.\n\nDuring the evaluation, ![color=5|Carol] planted a mine of strength 100 in sector LH. You will learn how mines work in the next step.\n\nAfter the evaluation, start entering the moves for year 4. You will be asked immediately for a new target planet for the captured spy.\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Send the captured spy to planet JM.]

TutorialText18_7I = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Mines]\n\n![img=tutorial/mines.png]\n\nWith mines you can make entire sectors of the universe impassable for battleships. Send a minelayer from a planet to the center of a sector. Once there, the minelayer turns into a live mine and destroys battleships that enter the sector. You can recognize minelayers by the icon ![img=tutorial/iconMineLayer12x12.png]. Minelayers fly 2 ly/year. Minelayers can be transferred to one of your planets to use them from there.\n\nThere are mines of types 50, 100, 250 and 500. A type 50 mine can destroy up to 50 battleships before becoming ineffective. Similarly, a type 100 mine can destroy 100 battleships, etc. If you place more mines in a mined sector, the strengths of the mines add up to a large mine.\n\nMinefields are represented on the playing field as a diamond with an indication of the mine strength.\n\n![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Minesweepers]\n\nSend minesweepers to the center of a sector or planet. On the way there, it clears all sectors flown through of mines at the speed of light. If the minesweepers's destination is a sector, it turns around there and flies back to his starting planet at twice the speed of light. On the way back, the minesweepers no longer clears mines.\n\nMinesweepers can be transferred to one of your planets to be deployed from there.\n\nYou can recognize minesweepers by the icon ![img=tutorial/iconMineSweeper12x12.png].

TutorialText19_7J = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|The Black Hole]\n\nIn the evaluation of year 8, the Black Hole appears at a random location. Every year it moves 2 light years further in a random direction. All spaceships that come within 0.5 light years of the center of the Black Hole are lost. If the center of the Black Hole enters a sector with mines, all mines there will be cleared. After a random number of years, the Black Hole disappears and reappears after some time.\n\nYou can recognize the Black Hole on the playing field by the symbol ![img=tutorial/iconBlackHole12x12.png].\n\n![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Neutral battleship fleets]\n\nIn the evaluation of year 10 and every five years thereafter, VEGA launches a fleet of neutral battleships flying from a randomly selected starting sector to a randomly selected target planet. When a neutral fleet conquers a planet, it becomes neutral again.

TutorialText20_7K = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Alliances]\n\nPlayers can declare individual planets to be alliance planets in order to defend them together with their battleships and launch joint attacks from there. Attack and defense losses are split proportionally.\nAllies can only command the battleships on the planet, not the other types of starships. Allies have full visibility into the planet's production data and supplies, but cannot change them.\n\nAllies can send their battleships to an Alliance planet without counting as an attack. Any Alliance partner that has at least one battleship on an Alliance planet can launch an Alliance fleet, becoming the leader of the Alliance fleet. The leader gets the planet when captured by the Alliance Fleet. The alliance structure of the starting planet is transferred to the conquered planet.\n\nThe principle "A player does not fight against his own battleships" applies. So if a player is a member of an alliance fleet and the target planet belongs to that player or is part of the alliance there, the battleships of the alliance fleet will merge with the battleships on the planet and the alliance will expand to include additional players if necessary.\n\nBefore you set up an alliance, you must coordinate with your alliance partners. They have to define the same alliance in the same year for it to actually take effect.\n\nAny alliance partner can dissolve an alliance without the consent of the other partners. All foreign battleships must leave the planet in the following evaluation, wait there until the end of the evaluation and no longer contribute to its defense. In the next turn input, the battleships must be sent to a new destination.\n\nAlliance changes are processed last of all turns, so you can still withdraw all your battleships or launch an alliance fleet before the end of an alliance. If you make multiple alliance changes for the same planet in the same year, only the last one will be honored.\n\nSometimes, allies on the same alliance planet may have entered conflicting moves. Example: Two players want to access the same battleships, but there are not enough battleships to implement both turns. In such a case, chance decides the order in which the moves are booked.

TutorialText21_7L = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Capitulate]\n\nIf your current situation seems hopeless to you, you can use the "Capitulate" command to raise the white flag and drop out of the game. All of your planets become neutral, all of your flying spaceships disintegrate, and you are eliminated from all alliances. However, the defense battleships, the $ supplies and spaceships that have not yet been launched will remain on your former planets. The capitulate command is implemented at the beginning of the evaluation.\n\n![size=1.5;color=1;bold|End of game]\n\nThe game is over when the agreed playing time is over or only one player is left. You can also end the game early with the consent of all players.\n\nThe player with the most planets wins.\n\n![size=1.5;color=1;bold|End of the tutorial]\n\nCongratulations! You have reached the end of the tutorial and are now familiar with the most important rules of the game. See the game guide for more information.
