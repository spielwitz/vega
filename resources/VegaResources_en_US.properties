TutorialText00_70 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|VEGA]\n\n![img=tutorial/iconShips.png]\n\nVEGA is a turn-based strategy game for 2 to 6 people in an 80s retro design. Whoever conquers the most planets with their spaceships wins the game. Play individually or in teams. Strategic thinking, diplomatic skills and a little luck are required. That's why VEGA is most fun in a friendly group of at least four players. There are no computer opponents, nor are there any graphic or sound effects.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn the most important rules of the game. You are Commander ![color=3|Alice] and start the conquest of space from your planet ![color=3|LM]. You have to assert yourself against your fellow players ![color=4|Bob] and ![color=5|Carol].

TutorialText01_71 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|The game board]\n\n![img=tutorial/board.png]\n\nThe VEGA game board consists of the square sectors AA to RT. The sectors have an edge length of one light year (1 ly). Planets are located at the center of some sectors. The planets ![color=3|LM], ![color=4|CH] and ![color=5|ND] belong to the players ![color=3|Alice], ![color=4|Bob] and ![color=5|Carol]. All other planets, e.g. ![color=2|JM], are neutral at the start of the game.\n\nSpaceships flying from one planet to another move in a straight line from the center of the starting sector to the center of the destination sector. This makes it very easy to calculate the distances, e.g. 2 ly from ![color=3|LM] to ![color=2|JM], 3 ly from ![color=3|LM] to ![color=2|LJ] and 3.606 ly from ![color=3|LM] to ![color=2|JJ].

TutorialText02_72 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|The year]\n\nVEGA is turn-based. A round is called a year. The game begins in year 1. The players enter their moves at the beginning of each year, then the computer evaluates the moves and moves the spaceships. Then the next year begins.\n\n![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Spaceships]\n\nIn VEGA there are the spaceship types: battleships, spies, transporters, patrols, minelayers and minesweepers. Each type flies at a certain constant speed, which allows the arrival time of a spaceship to be predicted exactly. Most spaceship types fly 2 light years per year. Battleships cover the distance from ![color=3|LM] to ![color=2|JM] in exactly one year. They need 1.5 light years to travel from ![color=3|LM] to ![color=2|LJ].

TutorialText03_73 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Battleships]\n\nYou can conquer and defend planets with battleships. Battleships fly 2 light years per year. You can send battleships out individually or in fleets. Battleships can be recognized by the symbol ![img=tutorial/iconFighters12x12.png]. The battleships that are available on the planets for attacks and defense can be seen in the list at the top right of the screen. At the start of the game, there are 350 battleships on the players' planets, and 0 to 10 on the neutral planets.\n\nIn addition, a planet can have up to 900 defensive battleships that contribute to defense but cannot be used for attacks. Defensive battleships are not visible in the list. To see whether a foreign planet has defensive battleships, you must send a spy to the planet or form an alliance with the owner. The players' starting planets have 450 defensive battleships, the neutral planets have 0.

TutorialText04_74 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Planets]\n\nPlanets produce money ($) and spaceships. You also need to have the most planets to win the game.\n\nPlanets produce between $1 and $15 annually. A new battleship is created from each $ produced. You can reduce the production of battleships and buy other types of spaceships, defensive battleships and combat bonus points from the $ you have saved up. You can also use $ to increase the planet's production in $5 increments up to $100/year.

TutorialText04a_F6 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Conquer and defend planets]\n\nSend battleships to conquer a foreign planet. You fight against all battleships on the planet, including the defensive battleships. The outcome of the battle is very easy to calculate:\n\nThe defender loses the number of attacking battleships, the attacker loses the number of defending battleships. If there are any attacker ships left, the attacker takes over the planet.\n\nExample:\n\nAttacker: 100\nDefender:  75\n\nAfter the fight:\n\nAttacker: 100 -  75 = 25\nDefender:  75 - 100 <  0\n\nIn this example, the attacker takes over the planet with 25 ships.

TutorialText04b_F7 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|The combat bonus]\n\nYou can increase the combat strength of a planet from 100% to 150% and 200%. When the planet is attacked, all battleships on the planet - including defensive battleships and battleships of allied partners - receive a 150% or 200% increase in strength. 100 battleships therefore act like 150 or 200 battleships. When you launch an attack on another planet from one planet, the battleships take on the combat strength of the starting planet.\n\nWith a higher combat strength, you can inflict more damage on the opponent while reducing your own losses. If both parties have the same combat strength, the effect is canceled out.

TutorialText05_75 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|The planet editor]\n\nNow start entering your moves. Open the planet editor for your planet ![color=3|LM]. To do this, first press the ![inverse|1] key for "Alice" in the main menu. In the move entry menu, select ![inverse|0] for "Planet" and enter the name of your planet ![color=3|LM].\n\nYou see the data for your planet ![color=3|LM]. Like all of the players' planets, it has $30 in stock at the start of the game and produces $10, which means 10 new battleships per year. You also see the 450 defensive battleships that defend the planet in addition to the regular battleships. The planet has a combat strength of 100%.\n\nBelow you see a list of other types of spaceships that you can buy or sell for 2/3 of the purchase price. The prices for all items change annually, but are the same on all planets in the universe.\n\nUse the up and down arrow keys to navigate between the items, and use left and right to decrease or increase the number of an item.\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Move the cursor to the line "Production of battleships/year", reduce the value to 0 and accept the changes with the ENTER key.]

TutorialText06_76 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Launch battleships]\n\nSend battleships to the neighboring planets. Since your opponents are far away and there are no attacks from neutral planets, you don't have to worry about defending your planet ![color=3|LM] yet.\n\nIn the turn input menu ![inverse|1], select "Battleships". Enter the fleet's starting and destination planet and the number of battleships.\n\nThe number is determined by the number of battleships on the target planet, its annual battleship production and the flight time of your battleships. You will only see the battleship production if you have a spy on the planet or have formed an alliance with the owner. In the early stages of the game, it is still easy to conquer neutral planets. There are no defensive battleships on neutral planets, and their production is between 1 and 15 battleships per year.\n\nYou want to conquer planet ![color=2|JM]. There are 8 battleships there and you reach the planet in year 1. If you send out 35 battleships, you will take over the planet with 27 battleships.\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Send 35 battleships from your planet LM to planet JM.]

TutorialText07_77 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Launch more battleships (1)]\n\nPress the right arrow key. You will see the spaceships that are currently on the move at the top right, i.e. your 35 battleships on the way from ![color=3|LM] to ![color=2|JM].\n\nPress the right arrow key several times to see more information until you see the list of battleships again.\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Send 35 battleships from your planet LM to planet JJ.]

TutorialText07a_F3 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Launch more battleships (2)]\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Send 80 battleships from your planet LM to planet LG.]

TutorialText08_78 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Buy a spy]\n\nSend a spy to another planet. The spy will install a radio transmitter there, which will give you full insight into the planet's data until the end of the game. You can  transfer a spy to a planet before deploying it from there. You can recognize spies by the symbol ![img=tutorial/iconScout12x12.png]. Spies in "mission" mode fly 4 light years per year, in "transfer" mode 2 light years per year.\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Open the planet editor of your planet LM and buy a spy. Confirm the purchase with the ENTER key.]

TutorialText09_79 = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Launch a spy]\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Send the spy from planet LM to planet NI in mission mode.]

TutorialText10_7A = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|The annual evaluation]\n\nYou have now entered all the moves for year 1 for the tutorial. In a real game, you would launch further attacks on neighboring planets with your remaining 200 battleships, change your planet's production ![color=3|LM] or buy other types of spaceships.\n\nComplete the move entry with the ![inverse|TAB] key and confirm the query with ![inverse|1] "Yes". Start the evaluation with ![inverse|TAB] "Evaluation" and go through the evaluation with the ![inverse|TAB] or ![inverse|0] keys.\n\nThe computer implements the moves and moves the spaceships in 365 day increments. You can see on which day a spaceship reaches its destination in the spaceship list at the top right. If two events take place on the same day, the order is decided by chance. On the last day of the year, the first battleships reach the planets ![color=2|CF], ![color=2|CJ], ![color=2|LD], ![color=2|NF] and ![color=2|JM].\n\nAt the end of the evaluation, all planets produce $ and new battleships. After that, the new year 2 begins and you are back in the main menu. You see that a battleship fleet, a minelayer and two spies are still on the way, which will reach their goals in the following evaluations.

TutorialText11_7B = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|The situation in year 2]\n\nStart the move entry for your user ![color=3|Alice] again. You have successfully conquered the planet ![color=3|JM]. Open the planet editor for the new planet ![color=3|JM]. The planet is very valuable with its annual production of $8. Therefore, you should protect it with defensive battleships, but the planet does not have enough $ for that.\n\nYou also see that ![color=4|Bob] has sent a spy to your new planet ![color=3|JM]. The spy reaches his goal in year 3.\n\nYour battleships to planet ![color=2|JJ] reach their goal in year 2. There are now 12 battleships on the planet, but this is not a problem for the 35 attacking battleships.\n\n![color=5|Carol], as if she had sensed your attack on planet ![color=2|LG], has sent a minelayer to sector ![color=2|LH] for a 100 mine. Learn more about mines in the next step.

TutorialText12_7C = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Buy a transporter]\n\nWith transporters you can transport up to $30 from planet to planet. If a transporter reaches a foreign planet, it is lost and its cargo is transferred to the planet. Transporters fly 2 light years per year and can be recognized by the symbol ![img=tutorial/iconTransport12x12.png].\n\nIn order to quickly buy a patrol that can intercept the approaching spy from ![color=4|Bob], you want to transport $ from the supply of the planet ![color=3|LM] to the planet ![color=3|JM].\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Open the planet editor of your planet LM and buy a single transporter. Then exit the planet editor with the ENTER key.]

TutorialText13_7D = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Launch a transporter]\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Send a transporter with $30 from planet LM to planet JM.]

TutorialText14_7E = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Evaluation of year 2]\n\nComplete the move input for year 2 and start the evaluation. During the evaluation, you will conquer the planet ![color=2|JJ] and have a spy on the planet ![color=2|NI]. From now on, you can view the data for the planet ![color=2|NI] at any time. In addition, your transporter will reach the planet ![color=3|JM] with $30.\n\nAfter the evaluation, start the move input for year 3.

TutorialText15_7F = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Buy a patrol]\n\nA patrol flies to a planet or any sector. It moves at 1 ly/year and captures enemy spies, transporters, minelayers, minesweepers, transferred patrols and battleship fleets with five ships or less within a radius of 1.5 ly. Captured ships do not move any further for the rest of the evaluation. You must select a new target planet for the captured ships in the following year.\n\nIf two enemy patrols meet in action, a fight ensues. The patrol that captures the other at a smaller angle to the direction of flight wins. If a patrol reaches a foreign planet, it is lost. If the target of the patrol is a sector, the patrol flies back to its starting planet and also observes on the way back. You can transfer patrols to another planet. They fly at 2 LY/year, but do not observe any ships.\n\nYou can recognize patrols by the symbol ![img=tutorial/iconPatrol12x12.png].\n\nThere are now enough $ on the planet ![color=3|JM] to buy a patrol.\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Open the planet editor of the planet JM and buy a patrol. Then exit the planet editor again with the ENTER key.]

TutorialText16_7G = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Launch a patrol]\n\nSend the patrol from the planet ![color=3|JM] towards the alien spy so that the spy gets into the patrol's observation circle and is captured.\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Send a patrol in "mission" mode from the planet JM to sector IL.]

TutorialText17_7I = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Mines]\n\n![img=tutorial/mines.png]\n\nWith mines you can make sectors of the playing field impassable for battleships. Send a mine from a planet into a sector. There the minelayer turns into a live mine and destroys battleships that cross the sector boundaries, including your own battleships. You can recognize minelayers by the symbol ![img=tutorial/iconMineLayer12x12.png]. Minelayers fly 2 light years per year. You can transfer minelayers to one of your planets to use them from there.\n\nThere are 50, 100, 250 and 500 mines. A 50 mine can destroy up to 50 battleships before it disappears. Accordingly, a 100 mine can destroy 100 battleships, and so on. If you place more mines in a mined sector, the strengths of the mines add up to a large mine. You can recognize the strength of a mine by the number in the diamond symbol.\n\n![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Minesweeper]\n\nSend a minesweeper to a sector or planet. On the way there, it flies at 1 light year/year and removes the mines from all the sectors it flies through. If the minesweeper's destination is a sector, it turns around and flies back to its starting planet at 2 light years/year, but does not clear any mines on the way back.\n\nYou can recognize minesweepers by the symbol ![img=tutorial/iconMineSweeper12x12.png].

TutorialText18_7H = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Evaluation of year 3]\n\nComplete the turn input for year 3 and start the evaluation.\n\nYour patrol detects and captures the foreign spy. The spy now waits for you to send him to another planet on the next turn input. He will fly there in "transfer" mode, i.e. he can be re-deployed from the target planet. Your patrol flies on to sector ![color=2|IL], which it will reach in year 4. There it will turn around and return to planet ![color=3|JM].\n\nMeanwhile, ![color=5|Carol] has placed a mine with a strength of 100 in the sector ![color=2|LH]. Shortly afterwards, your 80 battleships enter the mined sector and are destroyed. The mine then only has a strength of 20.\n\nAfter the evaluation, start the turn input for year 4. You will be asked for a new destination planet for the captured spy.\n\n![color=1|Task]: ![italic;color=1|Send the captured spy to planet JM.]

TutorialText19_7J = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|The black hole]\n\nIn the evaluation of year 8, the black hole appears for the first time in a random location. In each evaluation, it moves 2 light years in a random direction. All spaceships that are within a radius of 0.5 light years around the black hole are lost. If the black hole enters a sector with mines, all mines there are cleared. After a random number of years, the black hole disappears and after some time appears in a random location.\n\nThe black hole has the symbol ![img=tutorial/iconBlackHole12x12.png].\n\n![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Neutral battleship fleets]\n\nIn the evaluations of years 10, 15, 20, 25, etc., neutral battleship fleets start, flying from a random sector to a random planet. If a neutral fleet conquers a planet, the planet becomes neutral again.

TutorialText20_7K = ![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Alliances]\n\nPlayers can declare individual planets as alliance planets in order to jointly defend them and launch joint attacks from there. Losses from attacks and defenses are divided proportionally.\n\nAlliance partners can only control the battleships on the planet, not the other spaceship types. The alliance partners have full insight into the planet's production data and supplies, but cannot change them. Detailed information about alliances can be found in the game manual.\n\n![size=1.5;color=1;bold|Capitulate]\n\nIf the situation seems hopeless to you, you can use the "capitulate" command to raise the white flag and leave the game. All your planets become neutral, all your flying spaceships disintegrate, and you are eliminated from all alliances. However, the defensive battleships, the $ supplies, combat strengths, and spaceships that have not yet been launched remain on your former planets. The capitulation is implemented at the beginning of the evaluation.\n\n![size=1.5;color=1;bold|End of the game]\n\nThe game ends when the agreed playing time in years has passed or there is only one player left. You can end the game early with the consent of all players. The player with the most planets wins.
